## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Core Structure
```python
from google.adk.agents import LiveAgent
from google.adk.types import Content, Part
from google.adk.events import Event

class HomeownerAgent(LiveAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="homeowner",
            model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
            instructions=HOMEOWNER_INSTRUCTIONS,
            tools=[
                analyze_image,
                save_scope_fact,
                fetch_user_preferences,
                save_user_preference,
                generate_bid_card
            ]
        )
```

### Key Features to Implement

1. **Slot-Filling Conversation**
   - Project description
   - Budget range
   - Timeline
   - Location
   - Special requirements

2. **Image Analysis Integration**
   - Accept photo uploads
   - Analyze for project context
   - Extract relevant details

3. **Preference Learning**
   - Extract budget mentions
   - Save with confidence scores
   - Recall in future conversations

4. **State Management**
   - Use `user:` prefix for user-specific data
   - Use `app:` prefix for project data
   - Use `temp:` prefix for conversation context

def analyze_image(tool_context: ToolContext, image_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes uploaded images for project context.
    
    Args:
        tool_context (ToolContext): ADK tool context
        image_path (str): Path to uploaded image
    
    Returns:
